The paper aims at analysing the Heartland Payment Systemâ€™s case as one of the biggest and most relevant cases of data security breach and personal data breach. The work will initially describe the case providing some background history on the fact, in order to allow the reader to gain a clear understanding of the matter at hand. Secondly, the paper will identify the assets which have been compromised and the vulnerabilities that made the attack possible. By analysing the control weaknesses that have exposed the company to those above-mentioned vulnerabilities, the writers will provide some detailed response and prevention strategies using information security standards and frameworks (such as ISO and NIST). The report will finally debate on the pros and cons of such documents, highlighting their points of weakness and strength referring to the case of Heartland Payments System.
